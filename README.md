# track2dm package
This is an R package that can be used to create detection matrix from transect lines and account for topography variability. The scripts were developed based on the structure of dataset from the survey manuals. We used small sample of the data collected from the tiger occupancy survey in Sumatra. The main purpose of this document is to review how the package works in converting the field survey data into detection matrix to be used in occupancy analysis
