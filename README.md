# track2dm

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of track2dm is to create detection matrix from transect lines
that account for topography variability. The detection matrix is usually
used for hierarchical modelling of species occupancy and distribution
(see MacKenzie et al., 2004 about occupancy modelling).

## Installation

You can install the released version of track2dm and the development
version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ilubis85/track2dm")
```

## Example

We have provided some dataset to play with to understand how the package
works. Three types of data are needed, the track where the survey is
recorded spatially, the observation along the tracks and elevation as
raster data downloaded from USGS website.

``` r
# LOAD ALL DATA
# Read elevation raster data from the package
data("elevation")

# Read a survey track from the package
data("track")

# Read the observation from the package
data("observation")

# Convert dataframe (track and observation to spatial points data-frame
track_pt <- track2dm::df2sp(track, UTMZone = "+proj=utm +zone=47 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
observation_pt <- track2dm::df2sp(observation, UTMZone = "+proj=utm +zone=47 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
```

Track is a dataframe contains date and time, X, Y and usually Z
information downloaded from GPS. Whilst observation is a dataframe
contains any information about the observed species. The elevation is
needed to extract Z values to calculate distance in three dimension
(3D).

``` r
head(track, 5)

This is the data look like when we plot them using tmap package:

In that case, donâ€™t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
