A set of functions to create detection matrices from transect surveys
One of the questions which frequently addresses by wildlife scientists is about where the species occures in the landscape. This question is hampered by the fact that most of wildlife species cannot be perfectly detected due to several conditions such as the weather conditions, landscape characteristics, the observer experience, or the ecology of the species. For these reasons, the animals may present in the site, but the observer failed to detect it (__False Absence__) or the species was truly absent (__True Absence__). However, failing to detect species will underestimate the true occupancy of the species in the study areas. The management actions taken from incorrect estimation of species occurence will have negative impact to the species, especially when occupied habitat is cleared for other purposes.
